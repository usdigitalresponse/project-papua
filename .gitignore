# Amplify resources we're manually ignoring. May break things.

# There's a bunch of AWS-account specific data in here. Curious if we need to commit this:
amplify/team-provider-info.json

# We compile JS into this folder so that the Amplify CLI can produce a JS bundle.
amplify/backend/function/*/src
# We keep the package.json around though, because amplify only lets us hook in after
# it runs npm install, so it needs a package.json or else it errors.
# If the flow we use works well, we should open an upstream PR to amplify to make it
# just print a warning if there is no package.json.
