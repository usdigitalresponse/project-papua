            Insurance benefits:
            Direct Deposit (DD), which deposits your unemployment benefits into your
            checking or savings account.
            Electronic Payment Card (EPC), which works just like a debit card. The
            EPC is administered by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank. If you choose to receive
